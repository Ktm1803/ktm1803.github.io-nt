1. Edit `title` tag at line 13 (.html) :
     - you can change 'Profile NVB' to whatever title you want.
2. Edit `class = "name txt" ` at line 25(.html) to you name or to whatever you want.
3. Edit quote at line 27 to 31 (.html), `<br>` tag to separate the author's name with a carriage return. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95974734/221520480-c3477e12-42db-4168-a637-b53363911499.png)
4. Change avatar at line 35(.html) with attribute `src = ""` , you need to copy your image link and paste in between `" "`.
5. To change contact information you need to change some of the following properties:
     - Attribute `href="" ` of tag `<a>` 
     - icon is `<i> </i>` tag (available on <a href ="https://fontawesome.com/icons">Fotn Awesome</a>)
     - `class = "title-ico txt"`, the name of the software or whatever you want.
 (Some popular apps are included).<br/>
     If you want to add any profile, just copy the `<a ...> ... </a>` tag and paste it, then you can edit it as instructed above.
6. About highlights, you can edit " my project" at line 147(.css) with `content : "my project"` in file `base.css `(/acssets/css/base.css)
7. Similar to editing contact information, you can edit the highlight content with the `<a...> ... </a>` tags available in `class="outstanding"`
     - The link is still `href ="" ` in the `<a...>`.
     - Different from the icon in the contact information section, here use the image to display. You can replace it by pasting the image link into `src = " " ` located in the `<img src= "... ">`.
     - Change the title in the `<div class="item-name txt" > ... </div>` tag to your liking.<br/>
     If you want to add any profile, just copy the `<a ...> ... </a>` tag and paste it, then you can edit it as instructed above.

Good Luck !!!
